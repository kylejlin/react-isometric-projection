The react-isometric-projection package has two parts:

 1. The [`<IsometricProjection />`](https://github.com/kylejlin/react-isometric-projection/tree/master/docs/IsometricProjection.md) React component
 2. The [`meshLib`](https://github.com/kylejlin/react-isometric-projection/tree/master/docs/meshLib.md) object.

The `<IsometricProjection />` component is what's actually rendered.
The `meshLib` is a library that allows you to define meshes. It's not a component, but rather a tool that aids you in defining
meshes.

For more information, see the documentation file on each.
